# movies

This repo will house movie recommendations for kids graduating from high school between 2017 and 2025. This list would be given them at their graduation.

The current guidelines are:
* Movies released after Pulip Fiction
* No movies that make you want to die (ex: The English Patient)
* The Godfather makes the list
* There is no order and will be no order
* The list may change over time as some moves just don't hold up. You should take it as a sign that your recommendation was wrong if this happens and you should feel bad about it.

# books
This repo will also house book recommendation. This list is grouped by age group.
